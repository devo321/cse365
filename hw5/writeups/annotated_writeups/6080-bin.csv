6080-bin,23,For reasons unknown an amature cryptographer wrote an application to generate,
6080-bin,24,One of these keys was used to encrypt a tar archive,(I)
6080-bin,25,They used openssl command line util with -aes-128-cbc.,(I) 24
6080-bin,26,Could you please get the flag? It shouldn't take much time...,
6080-bin,27,Write-up,
6080-bin,28,After messing about with the keypass program it was obvious that the passphrase generation was weak,(I)
6080-bin,29,Lets generate some keys,(A) 28
6080-bin,30,done,
6080-bin,31,"Some of these inputs are invalid, the keyfile can be cleaned up or not, doesn't matter.",
6080-bin,32,Now let's check how many unique keys there are.,
6080-bin,33,"Cool, seems like all these keys are unique atleast.",
6080-bin,34,Now let's try to crack that zip-file using the following script.,(A)24
6080-bin,35,for k in $KEYS; do,
6080-bin,36,"openssl aes-128-cbc -d -in flag.zip.enc -out a -pass pass:""$k""",
6080-bin,37,done,
6080-bin,38,"After this, generation of keys of all possible inputs with 2 bytes was tested but this didn't",(I)
6080-bin,39,generate any more unique keys and took a long time.,
6080-bin,40,After flailing around for a bit this hint was dropped,
6080-bin,41,"However, when we check this on the running machine",
6080-bin,42,Lets try this operation on a kali machine instead.,(I)
6080-bin,43,root@kali:~# apt-get install openssl,
6080-bin,44,root@kali:~# unzip a,
6080-bin,45,extracting: flag.txt,(A) 42
