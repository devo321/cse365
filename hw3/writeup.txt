1. Opened source code and copied the password from the the source code and was given a bash shell.
2. Created a symlink and named it with the password, once running the program I was given a shell.
3. Similar to 2, except now I added my home directory to the path
4. Looked at source code for the pass, got it and ran program with it and was given an shell.
5. Grabbed hashed MD5 from source code and reversed it online, got password and was given a shell.
6. Found a value that when hashed will be a null byte, ran it, and got a shell.
7. Honestly I just used the C code provided to pass this level.
8. Created a symlink to .secret in my home directory and was able to get a shell.
9. Symlink to .secret, same as 8, was able to get a shell.
10. Set enviromnet variable BASE to expand to .secret
11. Same as 10 but this time needed to bypass strcmp() by adding an extra / to the begining of the BASE path
12. Same as 11 but no symlink.
13. Set base to be a file I can control and during the 5 second sleep phase I swapped the filename to give me a shell.
14. Command line injection, ./14 ";l33t" bash runs 14 then l33t
15. Same as 14 but needed to escape the " this time
16. Same as before but using $(l33t) instead
17. Created a symlink called tidy that pointed to bin/sh to give me a shell
18. Same as 17 but with executing l33t directly
19. Command line injection escaping the $ with "\$(l33t)
20. $ was filtered, so I useed && instead
21. Same as 20
22. Same as 20
23. Same as 20
24. Exploited -exec, needed bypass double quotes, got shell
25. Same as 24 but without bypassing double quotes.
26. Same as 24 but wasnt able to execute l33t directly so a symlink to l33t was used
27. Ran program, took the address of give me a shell and brute forced it into giving me a shell
28. Similar to 27 but Ghidra was used to find and overwrite the flag variable
29. Similar to 28 but flag is now a global variable
30. Injected a NOP sled and shellcode to give me a shell
31. Overflowed the buffer of strcpy() to access is_god and was given a shell.
32. This is where I stopped, got my assignment grade to something I was comfortable with and took the grade
Thank you forr an amazing semster! I had a great time in this class and found it very interesting!
